tag 1.2 freezes an old appraoch which was not well supportingmultiple active ans passive sessions.
This was based on ActPassive.hs
1.2 also feezes a verion of Session manager which resolves a problem using the base Network Simple library, where sockets can disappear in forked threads.

It is still possible to bundle a complete state object with the application to ensure that it has all neded context top operate.
