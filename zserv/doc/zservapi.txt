the route structure (ZRoute)

the route type field values are in lib/route_types.h, they enumerate the suppprted procols, + static, connected, kernel, system.
BGP is 9.
the 'msg' field is only used to indicate presence of the optional message values - it can be composed from them or their absence and should not be exposed above the wire format parsers.

it appears that the flag field corrresponds to the following defines, from lib/zebra.h

/* Zebra message flags */
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_INTERNAL           0x01
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_SELFROUTE          0x02
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_BLACKHOLE          0x04
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_IBGP               0x08
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_SELECTED           0x10
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_FIB_OVERRIDE       0x20
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_STATIC             0x40
#define ZEBRA_FLAG_REJECT             0x80

although passed over the API interface, it is clear that at least some of these flags are used internally, e.g.ZEBRA_FLAG_SELECTED marks routes which
have been pushed into the FIB, and ZEBRA_FLAG_SELFROUTE marks the routes which zebra originates
