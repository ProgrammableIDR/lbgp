-- binary format for AS path is a sequence of AS path segments
-- AS path segments are TLVs, however the 'length' is not a byte count
-- it is the number of included AS numbers
-- the type is 1 or two which codes either a Set or Sequence
-- note: 4 byte AS numbers may be used inthe AS PATH as well as in the AS4_PATH
-- therefore decoding AS_PATH requires to know whether 2 or 4 byte AS numbers are in use.
