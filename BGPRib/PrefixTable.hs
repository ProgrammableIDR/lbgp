{- A single prefix table holds everything about a prefix we could care about
 - but, this is merely the prefix itself, and the associated path
 -
 - for IPv4 the prefix including length fits in a 64 bit word, so can be the actual key
 - though it might be that a simple scarmable operation would make a better key for a tree...
 - Note also that the pathtable key is also a 64 bit word, so a map of Ints is all that is required....
 -
 - However, the LocRIB needs to access every prefix table when performing selection
 -
 - Note: the route selection algorithm is at the heart of this system, and is performed for every prefix inserted
 - hence a fast implementation is essential

-- TODO
-- prefix tabel semantics require prefixes to be removed from the table when routes are lost.
-- This is suboptimal, as well as leading to more complex code.
-- The proposal is to change the logic, and retain prefeixes in the table even when there are no longer
-- any routes to them.
-- This should have low impact in worst case, and is postive in all others
-- Contrived worst cases could involve huge numbers of transient prefixes, e.g. /32s
-- This could be mitigated by grooming the table at (quiet) ointervals

  Withdraw Operations

  'withdraw' is a wrapper around 'withdrawPrefixTable'.
  'withdrawPrefixTable' updates the prefixTable Map for a specific prefix
  Within 'withdrawPrefixTable' is an inner function which manipulates the route list for the prefix.
  The manipulation removes the given route, identified by the peer which originated it.
  In the case that the withdrawn route was the 'best' route then a Bool return flag is set to allow the calling context
  to send updates replacing the route which has been withdrawn.

  TODO

  Withdraw semantics require the withdrawn route to be known, because 'withdraw' should only be sent to peers
  which have received the corresponding route (e.g., dont' send a withdraw to a peer which originated a route..)
  As of now, withdraw only supports bare prefixes.

-- the kernel function of type (a -> Key -> b -> (a, c)) has concrete signature [IPrefix] -> IPrefix -> PrefixTableEntry -> ([IPrefix], PrefixTableEntry)
