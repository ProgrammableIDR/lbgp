-- parse/deparse the Open message, especially the optional parametes//capabilities
-- the optional parameter field has a (8bit) length sub-field followed by 0 or more 'parameters
-- parameters are coded as TLVs with 8bit T and L
-- only one parameter is currently used - '2' == Capabilities Optional Parameter
-- (see RFC5492)
-- within the 'Capabilities Optional Parameter' is another TLV encoding,
-- although there is no length field to start
--
-- open processing consists of a function useable within the FSM to process and generate Open messages including optional capabilities
-- this includes the logic to handle incompatible capability objectives
-- it also includes processing of the Hold timer values, AS number and BGPID
--
-- from the 'application level' it accepts parameters and shows what has been negotiated
-- 
-- the application level builds an initial state object
-- this is called by the FSM when it receives Open or wants to send Open (either ordering)
-- the response after receiving Open can be +ve or -ve, which should result in either Keepalive or Notification message
-- the underlying logic uses a copy of the resepective 'offers'
-- once keepalive or notification has been confirmed from remote side then the result is confirmed
--
-- the semanitics of the capabilities etc is transparent to this mechanism - i.e.
-- the application layer should simply provide a list of tuples representing
-- the objectives
--
-- Structure of an 'offer'
-- Hold Time
-- My AS
-- My BGPID
-- an (opaque) list of type/value tuples - 'offer'
--
-- additionally the application level can/should specify requirements
-- remote AS
-- remote BGPID
-- required type/value tuples
-- excluded type/value tuples
--
-- these may all be null in which case any offer is accepted
--
-- once an Open has been received a response is available
-- the Open populates a 'remote' offer structure, of identical form to the 'local' one
--
-- getResponse calculates the compliance of the remote offer with the local requirement
-- the response is a BGPMessage, either Keepalive or Notification
-- note that RFC4271 only allows a single error to be supplied in the Notification message
-- which is reported is determined by the orser of checks in the getResponse function
--
-- note: zero values are used to denote unenforced constraints in the 'required' section...

-- a naive check looks for identical values in capabilities,

-- of value.  This is clearly true for two common cases; AS4/32-bit ASNs, and Graceful Restart.
-- Note - there is no negotiation concept for Optional capabilities, and the responsibility for rejecting a peering lies with the prposer of a capability
-- which should arise when the peer has not advertised a capability which is required.
-- The present implementation consists simply of a check that the remote offer contains at least the capabilities in the required list.

-- this is the mentioned check for presecnce in remote offer of required parameters
-- return a list of capabilities required but not found in the offer
